<h1> Personal Finance Dashboard with Power BI</h1>

In this data analytics project, I have created a Personal Finance Dashboard using Power BI. This project is designed to help individuals effectively track their personal expenses, income, and financial goals. Whether you want to gain better insights into your financial habits or simply have a centralized tool for managing your finances, this dashboard can be a valuable resource.

- Visualize your income and expenses over time.
- Set and monitor financial goals.

- Gain a holistic view of your financial health.

This project is designed to be user-friendly and customizable, making it accessible to anyone who wants to take control of their personal finances.
